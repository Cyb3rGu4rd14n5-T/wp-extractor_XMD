ðŸ”± Tool Description for GitHub
wp-extractor.sh â€” by cyberguardians-T
A lightweight bash-based WordPress reconnaissance tool designed for bug bounty hunters and security researchers.

It scans a WordPress siteâ€™s exposed REST API (/wp-json) to extract:

âœ… Usernames from /wp-json/wp/v2/users

âœ… Emails (if publicly exposed)

âœ… Post titles from /wp-json/wp/v2/posts

The tool is interactive, bannered, and saves output to three separate files:

emails.txt

usernames.txt

post_titles.txt

This helps researchers quickly identify misconfigured WordPress sites that may expose internal or sensitive user data â€” a common bug bounty finding.

ðŸ“¦ Features:
Fully bash-based, no Python or setup needed.

Automatically sanitizes URLs (even if full paths like /blog/ are given).

Clears old output each time for clean results.

Stylish ASCII banner for branding.

Works on Kali Linux, Parrot, Ubuntu, WSL, etc.
